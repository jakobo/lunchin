Wheel of LunchIn Master Files

How does it work?
* The wheel starts on "in BONUS"
* The wheel must make at least one full rotation
* The restaurant selected is the Lunch Location

Special Slots:
* BONUS: Spin again, using only the 12 icons in the inner ring
* Oh Yes (Bonus Spin): Spin again, using the outer 24 icons. LinkedIn will pay for it!

FAQs:
* What if I spin "BONUS", "Oh Yes", "BONUS"? Lucky you! You're going to be spinning a 4th time. LinkedIn is going to be paying for a nice lunch on the inner ring!
* What are the odds?
  * Bonus Restaurant: 1/24
  * LinkedIn Pays for Common Restaurant: 1/288
  * LinkedIn Pays for Bonus Restaurant: 1/6912
  * LinkedIn Pays for that really awesome Benihana slot I'm eyeing: 1/82944
